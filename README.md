# Deep-Learning-Workshop
 Files presented in ICAHT workshop ...

ICAHT is the first international congress on
'Advanced Health Technologies-Artificial Intelligence in Medicine'


In this congress I was instructor in deeplearning workshop.

## Topics
* Multi layer perceptron (MLP) \\
	A regresion for sin function and classificaiton of MNIST dataset.
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Variational Auto Encoders (VAE)
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

All the codes were implemented with Tensorflow 2 and Keras.
